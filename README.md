How I Approach Designing Software

When designing software, I start by breaking the problem into smaller, modular components. I focus on the overall structure and flow before diving into detailed implementation. For my 3D scene project, I first visualized how each object, light source, and transformation would interact within the environment. I relied heavily on object-oriented design principles to ensure each part of the project—shapes, shaders, materials, and lighting—was reusable and clearly organized.

Design Skills and Process

This project helped me develop a stronger understanding of scene composition, lighting balance, and the importance of shaders in creating realism. I followed an iterative design process: plan, implement, test, and refine. Each milestone built upon the previous one, which helped me visualize the design evolving from simple shapes to a fully realized 3D world. These same tactics—iterative design, testing small changes, and modular planning—will guide me in future development projects.

Approach to Developing Programs

I approached development by combining incremental coding and continuous testing. In the early stages, I focused on getting the shapes and camera controls working correctly, then progressively added texture and lighting. Iteration was key: each milestone provided an opportunity to refine my techniques and fix small issues before they became larger problems. By the end, I had built a complete 3D environment using clean, reusable code that adhered to best practices.

Evolution of My Coding Approach

Throughout the milestones, my confidence in using OpenGL and applying mathematical transformations grew significantly. Initially, I focused more on getting functionality to work, but by the end, I prioritized writing clear, maintainable, and visually effective code. I also learned the value of debugging shaders and lighting step by step to achieve the desired effect.

How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals

My long-term goal is to become a data analyst. Although this project focused on computational graphics, it strengthened my understanding of spatial reasoning, logic structures, and data-driven visualization—all of which are essential in analytics. Computational graphics and visualizations teach how to translate data and abstract concepts into visual meaning, a skill that aligns directly with my future career in analyzing and communicating insights effectively.
